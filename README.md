============================================================================

Click the link ðŸ”— below to see the project in action ðŸš€!

https://yesterdays-news.onrender.com

Hosted using Render and Elephant SQL.

## Project Summary
A functional and (almost) complete backend API that simulates a Reddit-like small scale server. Exciting features such as viewing (topics, articles, comments, users), deleting (comments, posts), updating article votes, and filtering, ordering and searching for specific articles.

Test-Driven Development was a core focus of the project, so the project features a comprehensive test suite made with jest, jest-sorted and supertest. The application itself uses express and pg to deliver CRUD operations and the project's primary functionality. Written mainly using JavaScript and SQL.
